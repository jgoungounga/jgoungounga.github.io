  <meta name="description" content="BACKGROUND: Non-cancer mortality in cancer patients may be higher than overall mortality in the general population due to a combination of factors, such as long-term adverse effects of treatments, and genetic, environmental or lifestyle-related factors. If so, conventional indicators may underestimate net survival and cure fraction. Our aim was to propose and evaluate a mixture cure survival model that takes into account the increased risk of non-cancer death for cancer patients.

METHODS: We assessed the performance of a corrected mixture cure survival model derived from a conventional mixture cure model to estimate the cure fraction, the survival of uncured patients, and the increased risk of non-cancer death in two settings of net survival estimation, grouped life-table data and individual patients&#39; data. We measured the model&#39;s performance in terms of bias, standard deviation of the estimates and coverage rate, using an extensive simulation study. This study included reliability assessments through violation of some of the model&#39;s assumptions. We also applied the models to colon cancer data from the FRANCIM network.

RESULTS: When the assumptions were satisfied, the corrected cure model provided unbiased estimates of parameters expressing the increased risk of non-cancer death, the cure fraction, and net survival in uncured patients. No major difference was found when the model was applied to individual or grouped data. The absolute bias was &lt; 1% for all parameters, while coverage ranged from 89 to 97%. When some of the assumptions were violated, parameter estimates appeared more robust when obtained from grouped than from individual data. As expected, the uncorrected cure model performed poorly and underestimated net survival and cure fractions in the simulation study. When applied to colon cancer real-life data, cure fractions estimated using the proposed model were higher than those in the conventional model, e.g. 5% higher in males at age 60 (57% vs. 52%).

CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis supports the use of the corrected mixture cure model, with the inclusion of increased risk of non-cancer death for cancer patients to provide better estimates of indicators based on cancer survival. These are important to public health decision-making; they improve patients&#39; awareness and facilitate their return to normal life.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract"><p>BACKGROUND: Non-cancer mortality in cancer patients may be higher than overall mortality in the general population due to a combination of factors, such as long-term adverse effects of treatments, and genetic, environmental or lifestyle-related factors. If so, conventional indicators may underestimate net survival and cure fraction. Our aim was to propose and evaluate a mixture cure survival model that takes into account the increased risk of non-cancer death for cancer patients.</p>
<p>METHODS: We assessed the performance of a corrected mixture cure survival model derived from a conventional mixture cure model to estimate the cure fraction, the survival of uncured patients, and the increased risk of non-cancer death in two settings of net survival estimation, grouped life-table data and individual patients&rsquo; data. We measured the model&rsquo;s performance in terms of bias, standard deviation of the estimates and coverage rate, using an extensive simulation study. This study included reliability assessments through violation of some of the model&rsquo;s assumptions. We also applied the models to colon cancer data from the FRANCIM network.</p>
<p>RESULTS: When the assumptions were satisfied, the corrected cure model provided unbiased estimates of parameters expressing the increased risk of non-cancer death, the cure fraction, and net survival in uncured patients. No major difference was found when the model was applied to individual or grouped data. The absolute bias was &lt; 1% for all parameters, while coverage ranged from 89 to 97%. When some of the assumptions were violated, parameter estimates appeared more robust when obtained from grouped than from individual data. As expected, the uncorrected cure model performed poorly and underestimated net survival and cure fractions in the simulation study. When applied to colon cancer real-life data, cure fractions estimated using the proposed model were higher than those in the conventional model, e.g. 5% higher in males at age 60 (57% vs. 52%).</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis supports the use of the corrected mixture cure model, with the inclusion of increased risk of non-cancer death for cancer patients to provide better estimates of indicators based on cancer survival. These are important to public health decision-making; they improve patients&rsquo; awareness and facilitate their return to normal life.</p>
