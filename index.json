Net survival estimation is commonly based on the excess hazard approach in which the hazard rate of individuals is assumed to be the sum of a disease-specific and expected hazard rate, supposed to be correctly approximated by the mortality rates obtained from general population life tables. However, this assumption might not be realistic if the study participants are not comparable with the general population. Also, the hierarchical structure of the data can induce a correlation between the outcomes of individuals coming from the same clusters (e.g., hospital, registry). We proposed an excess hazard model that corrects simultaneously for these two sources of bias, instead of dealing with them independently as before. We assessed the performance of this new model and compared it with three similar models, using an extensive simulation study, as well as an application to breast cancer data from a multicenter clinical trial. The new model performed better than the others in terms of bias, root mean square error, and empirical coverage rate. The proposed approach might be useful to account simultaneously for the hierarchical structure of the data and the non-comparability bias in studies such as long-term multicenter clinical trials, when there is interest in the estimation of net survival.\r\n","tags":["Bias Correction","Multicenter Trials","Survival Analysis","Statistical Models"],"title":"Correcting for heterogeneity and non-comparability bias in multicenter clinical trials with a rescaled random-effect excess hazard model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura Botta","Juste Goungounga","Riccardo Capocaccia","Gaelle Romain","Marc Colonna","Gemma Gatta","Olayidé Boussari","Valérie Jooste"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

If so, conventional indicators may underestimate net survival and cure fraction. Our aim was to propose and evaluate a mixture cure survival model that takes into account the increased risk of non-cancer death for cancer patients.\rMETHODS: We assessed the performance of a corrected mixture cure survival model derived from a conventional mixture cure model to estimate the cure fraction, the survival of uncured patients, and the increased risk of non-cancer death in two settings of net survival estimation, grouped life-table data and individual patients' data. We measured the model's performance in terms of bias, standard deviation of the estimates and coverage rate, using an extensive simulation study. This study included reliability assessments through violation of some of the model's assumptions. We also applied the models to colon cancer data from the FRANCIM network.\rRESULTS: When the assumptions were satisfied, the corrected cure model provided unbiased estimates of parameters expressing the increased risk of non-cancer death, the cure fraction, and net survival in uncured patients. No major difference was found when the model was applied to individual or grouped data. The absolute bias was \u003c 1% for all parameters, while coverage ranged from 89 to 97%. When some of the assumptions were violated, parameter estimates appeared more robust when obtained from grouped than from individual data. As expected, the uncorrected cure model performed poorly and underestimated net survival and cure fractions in the simulation study. When applied to colon cancer real-life data, cure fractions estimated using the proposed model were higher than those in the conventional model, e.g. 5% higher in males at age 60 (57% vs. 52%).\rCONCLUSIONS: The present analysis supports the use of the corrected mixture cure model, with the inclusion of increased risk of non-cancer death for cancer patients to provide better estimates of indicators based on cancer survival. These are important to public health decision-making; they improve patients' awareness and facilitate their return to normal life.\r","tags":["Cancer","Cure Model","Non-Cancer Mortality","Survival Analysis","Statistical Models"],"title":"A new cure model that corrects for increased risk of non-cancer death: analysis of reliability and robustness, and application to real-life data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Noémi Reboux","Valérie Jooste","Juste Goungounga","Michel Robaszkiewicz","Jean-Baptiste Nousbaum","Anne-Marie Bouvier"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The difference in prognosis between patients with synchronous and metachronous liver metastases is controversial.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate temporal patterns in the incidence and outcomes of synchronous vs metachronous liver metastases from colorectal cancer.\r\n\r\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study used information from a French regional digestive cancer registry accounting for 1,082,000 inhabitants. A total of 26,813 patients with a diagnosis of incident colorectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed between January 1, 1976, and December 31, 2018, were included. Data were analyzed from February 7 to May 20, 2022.\r\n\r\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age-standardized incidence was calculated. Univariate and multivariate net survival analyses were performed.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Of 26,813 patients with colorectal cancer (15,032 men [56.1%]; median [IQR] age, 73 [64-81] years), 4,546 (17.0%) presented with synchronous liver metastases. The incidence rate of synchronous liver metastases was 6.9 per 100,000 inhabitants in men and 3.4 per 100,000 inhabitants in women, with no significant variation since 2000. The 5-year cumulative incidence of metachronous liver metastases decreased from 18.6% (95% CI, 14.9%-22.2%) during the 1976 to 1980 period to 10.0% (95% CI, 8.8%-11.2%) during the 2006 to 2011 period. Cancer stage at diagnosis was the strongest risk factor for liver metastases; compared with patients diagnosed with stage II cancer, patients with stage III cancer had a 2-fold increase in risk (subdistribution hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 2.08-2.82) for up to 5 years. Net survival at 1 year was 41.8% for synchronous liver metastases and 49.9% for metachronous metastases, and net survival at 5 years was 6.2% for synchronous liver metastases and 13.2% for metachronous metastases. Between the first (1976-1980) and last (2011-2016) periods, the adjusted ratio of death after synchronous and metachronous metastases was divided by 2.5 for patients with synchronous status and 3.7 for patients with metachronous status.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the incidence of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases changed little over time, whereas there was a 2-fold decrease in the probability of developing metachronous liver metastases. Survival improved substantially for patients with metachronous liver metastases, whereas improvement was more modest for those with synchronous metastases. The differences observed in the epidemiological features of synchronous and metachronous liver metastases from colorectal cancer may be useful for the design of future clinical trials.\r\n","tags":["Colorectal Cancer","Liver Metastases","Survival Analysis","Epidemiology","Oncology"],"title":"Incidence and Survival in Synchronous and Metachronous Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc Colonna","Pascale Grosclaude","Anne Marie Bouvier","Juste Goungounga","Valérie Jooste"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The proposed statistical approach describes the health status of this group by estimating the probabilities of death among prevalent cases. The application concerns colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancers and melanoma in France in 2017.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Excess mortality was used to estimate the probabilities of death from cancer and other causes.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: For the studied cancers, most deaths from cancer occurred during the first 5 years after diagnosis. The probability of death from cancer decreased with increasing time since diagnosis except for breast cancer, for which it remained relatively stable. The time beyond which the probability of death from cancer became lower than that from other causes depended on age and cancer site: for colorectal cancer, it was 6 years after diagnosis for women (7 years for men) aged 75-84 and 20 years for women (18 years for men) aged 45-54 years, whereas cancer was the major cause of death for women younger than 75 years whatever the time since diagnosis for breast and for all patients younger than 75 years for lung cancer. In contrast, deaths from other causes were more frequent in all the patients older than 75 years. Apart from breast cancer in women younger than 55 years and lung cancer in women older than 55 years and men older than 65 years, the probability of death from cancer among prevalent cases fell below 1%, with varying times since diagnosis.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The authors' approach can be used to better describe the burden of cancer by estimating outcomes in prevalent cases.\r\n","tags":["Cancer","Mortality Dynamics","Prevalence","Health Status","Statistical Models"],"title":"Health status of prevalent cancer cases as measured by mortality dynamics (cancer vs. noncancer): Application to five major cancer sites","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" Packages utiles library(\u0026quot;parallel\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;foreach\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;microbenchmark\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) Contexte Supposons que l’on souhaite estimer la qualité de prédiction d’un modèle linéaire, ici un modèle linéaire pour la régression de la largeur d’une pétale sur une longueur sur le jeu de données iris de R.
